[Google-fu](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Google-fu) means "skill in using search engines (especially **Google** ) to quickly find useful information on the Internet". Sometimes we have a hard time yielding any effective results when using a search engine, however, there is a technique referred to as Google-fu that will help us to find more specific results.

In this post, I will show you some crucial tips for refining your Google-fu.

## Modifiers

Google Search is always case-insensitive and usually ignores punctuation that isn't part of a search.

+ `"exact word or phrase"` --- quotation
  - force an exact-match search with all characters and in the order specified

+ `(search groups)` --- parentheses
  - group terms and control the order without memorizing the precedence

+ `OR` --- logical word
  - "OR" must be in ALL-CAPS, you can use the pipe symbol (`|`) alternatively if your CapsLock is broken

+ `-` --- exclusion
  - place immediately before the certain term you want to leave out

+ `+` --- inclusion
  - give priority to the precisely used term to force Google to return which might be discarded

+ `..` --- number range
  - put two dots between two numbers for two full stops to match within the number range

+ `*` --- asterisk
  - act as a wildcard to replace any single word or leave blank

+ `~` --- tilde
  - bring back synonyms, now is the default

+ `to` or `in`
  - convert measurements from one unit to another

+ `@` search social media, `$` search price, `#` search hashtag

## Operators

Syntax: `operator:search_term`. Don't put spaces between the operator and your search term.

+ `site:`
  - restrict search results to a specific domain, it only accepts full domain, root domain, and Top-Level Domain (TLD)

+ `related:`
  - return sites that are related to a target domain, it only works for large domains

+ `link:`
  - find pages with links to a target domain, only provides a sample of backlinks

+ `cache:`
  - show Google's cached version of a page

+ `filetype:`
  - specify a particular file extension, such as ".pdf", ".doc", or even ".html"

+ `intitle:` and `allintitle:`
  - return only search results that match in the page's title, for a single word and multiple words respectively.

+ `intext:` and `allintext`
  - return only results that match in the page's body/document text

+ `inurl:` and `allinurl:`
  - return only results that match in the page's URL text

+ `inanchor:` and `allinanchor:`
  - return only results that match in the page's anchor text or links

## Combos

Having all the pieces is only the first step in building a puzzle. The real power of Google-fu comes from combos.
