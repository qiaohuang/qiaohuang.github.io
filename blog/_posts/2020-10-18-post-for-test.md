Post to try the features out.

### Playground

{% highlight python %}
x = ('a', 1, False)
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Qiao')
#=> prints 'Hi, Qiao' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

$$ P(o|c) = \frac{\exp (u_o^Tv_c)}{\sum_{w\in V}\exp(u_w^Tv_c)} $$

$$ J=-\log(\sigma(u_o^Tv_c)) - \sum_{k=1}^K\mathbb{E}_{k\sim P(w)}\log(\sigma(-u_k^Tv_c)) $$
