Welcome to __[my notes](/notes)__ â€” a digital garden where share notes of my learning, and seeds of my thoughts, to be cultivated in public. ðŸŒ±

In fact, my notes are on another [GitHub page](https://www.uniqiao.com/notes/), which is hosted on another [GitHub repo](https://github.com/qiaohuang/notes). This post just serve as an index.

Notes are not polished or comprehesive, but serve more like memory jogs. I'm sharing my notes because a). making them public may help motivate me; b). they can give anyone who cares a good sense of what I do; c). they might be useful to others.

{: .box-warning}
I'll write notes for myself "by default". So if a note seems confusing, under-explained, or don't make much sense,  I'm sorry, it's probably because I didn't write for you.
