![Welcome to uniQiao](/images/welcome.svg "Free to explore")

## What I talk about?
I use this site to update my journey to becoming a data scientist.

Topics will include but are not limited to, __Statistics__, __Programming__, and __Personal Experience__. I will explain the math concepts at the level of an undergraduate. As a new coder, I will also share a lot of __Learning Resources__ carefully chosen! You can subscribe `via RSS` to keep the site up to date automatically with the Posts. For macOS, I recommend [Vienna](https://www.vienna-rss.com/), and [QuiteRSS](https://quiterss.org/) is the alternative for Windows.

## How I build this?
_uniQiao.com_ is a static web site. I make it responsive to comments and discussion by using [Staticman](https://staticman.net/), with protection from robots provided by [reCAPTCHA](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/about).

I host the domain name at _namesilo.com_.

This site is in a repository at [GitHub](https://github.com/qiaohuang/qiaohuang.github.io) and is hosted by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). It will trigger [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the site when GitHub Pages detects any changed file in the repo.

I write articles in Jekyll's [kramdown](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/) and render equations by [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/).

Wherever possible, I will use the `.svg` graphic format for images (like the `GIF` above) since the nice display on different screen sizes.

Thanks for reading. More articles to come soon!ðŸš€
