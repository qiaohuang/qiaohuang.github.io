![Welcome to uniQiao](/images/welcome.svg "Free to explore")

<span style="color: gray">Welcome to uniQiao!  
Site name stands for "unique" Qiao, or any "uni-" words you think.</span>

## What I talk about?

I use this site to update my journey to becoming a data scientist.

Topics will include but are not limited to, Statistics, Programming, and Personal Experience. I will explain the math concepts at the level of an undergraduate. As a new entrant and a dedicated lifelong learner, I will also share a lot of __[Learning Resources](/resources)__ carefully chosen! You can subscribe `via RSS` to keep the site up to date automatically with the Posts.

## How I built this?

I registered the domain name at [NameSilo](https://www.namesilo.com/) on May 10, 2020, and launched the site by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) on October 17, 2020.

This site is in a [repository](https://github.com/qiaohuang/qiaohuang.github.io) at GitHub. It will trigger [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the site when GitHub Pages detects any changed file in the repo.

_uniQiao.com_ is a static web site. I make it responsive to comments and discussion by using [Staticman](https://staticman.net/) hosted on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/), with protection from robots provided by [reCAPTCHA](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/about).

I write articles in Jekyll's [kramdown](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/) and render equations by [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/).

Wherever possible, I will use the `.svg` graphic format for images (like the `GIF` above) since the nice display on different screen sizes.

## RSS

The [[everything feed](/feed.xml)] is for, well, everything.

For separate feed, you can get only [[blog feed](/blog/feed.xml)], and [[projects feed](/projects/feed.xml)].

For macOS users, I recommend [Vienna](https://www.vienna-rss.com/), and [QuiteRSS](https://quiterss.org/) is the alternative for Windows.

## Corrections

If you see any mistakes or want to suggest any changes, please create an [issue](https://github.com/qiaohuang/qiaohuang.github.io/issues/new) in the source repo or comment here. ([How comments work?](/test#comments))
