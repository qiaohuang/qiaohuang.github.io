I hold a Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics.
My thesis research interest was stock analysis and forecasting.

During the last year at university, I taught myself Economics systematically
and had exposure to Quantitative analysis. To complete my bachelor thesis,
I started learning Python and Machine Learning through online resources.

Therefore, I entered the Data Science world!
